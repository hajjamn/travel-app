# Welcome to our Travel-App

- We have implemented a Netlify hosted server connected to MongoDB via serverless functions
- To make it run in local you need to install the node package manager if node is already present in your device, in the CLI write "npm install", then you need the netlify CLI by writing "npm install netlify-cli -g"
- You can also use some commands to login and link your deployed application by running these commands "ntl login" and "ntl link" but we will not be needing these
- To run your server locally now the only thing left is for you to use "ntl dev" to locally host your application and we're set! you can now use the application locally
